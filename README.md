# AShawPortfolio

This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU! 

# About Me
My name is Aly Shaw, my pronouns are she/her or they/them. This is my final semester and final class in the MPM program. 

# What I hope to get out of the course and after graduation
I work at a small nonprofit that runs public policy campaigns in Western PA. After graduating I am transitioning to a new position at work focused on policy research and I plan to use what I learn in this class to improve my ability to easily communicate complex ideas and data to diverse stakeholders. My organization needs to communicate policy ideas and data to both residents and elected officials in a way that makes our points clear and makes our organization look professional.

## Assignment 2 Data Visualization for OIG Data (News article)

For this visualization project I decided to use a pictorial graphic that showed highlighted the amount of people in detention that have been held over the standard time limit of 72 hours, or 3 days. I thought this way of displaying the information would humanize the data because the visualization literally shows human figures and allowed me to use color to highlight the critical parts. In the text of the article I would mention that this represents 8,000 people and the full number of people represented by the orange and red portions. Finally, I decided to change the 72 hours to 3 days so that it was standard with the 10 days aspect and so that it was easier for the reader to understand.

## Assignment 2 Data Visualization for OIG Data (Internal)

I chose three simple visualizations that would go along with this report for an internal government office. For the first one, I went with a simple bar chart highlighting the growth in apprehensions over a one year period which serves as the root of the problem that this report discusses. I highlighted the growth in orange, represented the number of apprehensions with a ###k format, and left the acronym of (UAC) in for space and because it had already been explained earler in the report. Next, I chose a half donut to highlight the amount of people and children that had been held past the standard 72 hours. For this visualization I did not need to do as much to humanize the data (although maybe I should have) so I chose a form that I thought would simply show the percentage of people that were being detained in a way that violated federal standards, both for adults and children. Finally, to highlight another major issue being discussed in the report, I decided to use a donut graphic to highlight the funding gaps that are also a primary cause of these problems.

## Visualization Redesign Child Poverty Rates

![originalmap](http://www.nccp.org/publications/images/wpc10-fig2.jpg)

For this redesign I wanted to draw attention to the states that had the highest child poverty rates immediately when the reader looked at the map. For all stakeholders, citizens or elected officials, this map is simple and easy to read because the colors are intuative: darker red is worse. The legend simply conveys the scale and because the map is interactive, people can find the state name and the exact childhood poverty rate by simply hovering their cursor over the state. I updated the data with 2017 data sourced from the census and provided in a report by the Children's Defense Fund.
