# AShawPortfolio

This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU! 

# About Me
My name is Aly Shaw, my pronouns are she/her or they/them. This is my final semester and final class in the MPM program. 

# What I hope to get out of the course and after graduation
I work at a small nonprofit that runs public policy campaigns in Western PA. After graduating I am transitioning to a new position at work focused on policy research and I plan to use what I learn in this class to improve my ability to easily communicate complex ideas and data to diverse stakeholders. My organization needs to communicate policy ideas and data to both residents and elected officials in a way that makes our points clear and makes our organization look professional.
